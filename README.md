# Grid

Grid is a web game where your job is to fix the water grid by connecting the house to the water source using only the pipes provided. Levels are randomly generated, and you can play either easy or hard ones. The game also features original pixel art and it is all completely open source!

The game was written using vanilla TypeScript and works entirely using DOM manipulation - no canvas is needed. It can still scale to fit any window size and is played using only the mouse. This project was made for Hack Club Siege for the theme "grid". I chose the idea because the game is both about the services grid and the game is played using an actual grid layout.
